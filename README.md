I'm a Computer Engineer passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Infrastructure. I love deploying LLMs to production, building computer vision projects, and working with Kubernetes and Docker to make AI systems scalable.

Currently focused on fine-tuning large language models, deploying AI solutions to cloud platforms, and experimenting with the latest techniques in machine learning. I enjoy turning research papers into working code and solving real-world problems with AI.
