# Hi there, I'm Baran Basaran 👋

I'm a Computer Engineer passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Infrastructure, and bringing AI solutions to life. With international experience across Turkey, Netherlands, and the USA, I love building end-to-end AI systems and exploring the intersection of machine learning and scalable infrastructure.

I'm actively deploying LLMs to production environments, fine-tuning models for real-world applications, and building computer vision projects that solve practical problems. Whether it's containerizing AI workloads or optimizing cloud deployments, I'm always learning and experimenting with the latest technologies.

I enjoy discussing AI, cloud architecture, and innovative tech solutions. If you're working on something exciting or want to collaborate, let's connect!

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- **LLM Deployment & Fine-tuning:** Deploying models like Pixtral 12B on Google Cloud Vertex AI with custom containers and A100 GPUs
- **Container Orchestration:** Building and managing containerized applications with Docker and Kubernetes on production environments
- **Computer Vision Projects:** Developing real-time object detection systems with YOLOv8 and Arduino integration
- **AI Research:** Staying current with the latest research papers and implementing state-of-the-art techniques

## 🔥 Featured Projects

- **[LanPilot](https://github.com/basaranbaran/LanPilot)** ⭐ 3 - A low-latency, browser-based remote desktop controller for local networks. Control your PC via smartphone without internet access.

- **[AI-Powered Distance Alert With Arduino](https://github.com/basaranbaran/AI-Powered-Distance-Alert-With-Arduino)** ⭐ 2 - YOLOv8 and Arduino-based real-time human detection and distance warning system with visual/audio alerts.

- **[LLM Deployment to Google Vertex AI](https://github.com/basaranbaran/LLM-Deployment-to-Google-Vertex-AI)** - Step-by-step guide to deploying Pixtral 12B on Google Cloud Vertex AI using custom containers and A100 GPUs.

- **[AI Infiltrator Game](https://github.com/basaranbaran/ai-infiltrator-game)** ⭐ 1 - A detective game where you identify AI agents among humans - survival and investigation against AI.

- **[Wikipedia Speedrun AI](https://github.com/basaranbaran/wikipedia_speedrun_ai)** - AI solution for the Wikipedia speedrun game using sentence transformers and LLMs.

## 🎯 What I've Been Up To

**Deploying LLMs to Production**
Recently completed a freelance project for a UK-based company where I deployed Mistral LLM end-to-end on Google Cloud. The challenge? Deploying Pixtral 12B to Google Vertex AI with minimal documentation available - figured it out through experimentation and deep diving into cloud infrastructure.

**Building AI Infrastructure @ Halkbank**
Spent my internship getting hands-on with the real stuff - Linux systems, Docker, Kubernetes, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Wrote automation scripts, explored Ray for distributed AI workloads, and learned how enterprise-scale container orchestration actually works.

**Working Remotely with International Teams**
Worked for a year with ON Social, a Netherlands-based startup, fully remote and 100% in English. Led multiple sprints as Scrum Master, drove product growth strategies, and learned what it takes to ship features that users actually want.

**Living and Learning Abroad**
Spent 6 months studying in Washington D.C. at Bay Atlantic University - an experience that sharpened my English and exposed me to different perspectives on tech and innovation.

**Contributing to Turkish AI Education**
Volunteering as a Turkish subtitle editor and translator for Welch Labs, making high-quality AI and mathematics educational content accessible to Turkish-speaking learners. Because everyone deserves access to great learning resources.

## 🌱 What I'm Passionate About

**AI in Production** - Moving beyond notebooks and demos to actually deploying AI models that people can use. There's something satisfying about seeing your model running on cloud infrastructure, serving real requests.

**Making Complex Tech Accessible** - Whether it's through translating educational content to Turkish or building tools that simplify workflows, I believe technology should empower everyone, not just experts.

**Learning by Building** - I stay current with the latest AI research papers and immediately try to implement interesting techniques. The best way to learn is to get your hands dirty with code.

**International Collaboration** - Having worked with teams in Netherlands, USA, and UK, I've learned that the best innovations happen when diverse perspectives come together.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills

**Advanced Experience:**
- Python, Google Cloud Platform, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes
- LLM Deployment, Fine-tuning, Quantization
- Computer Vision (YOLOv8, OpenCV)

**Working Knowledge:**
- Java, React, Microsoft Azure, AWS
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architectures
- Sentiment analysis and NLP applications

**Other Competencies:**
- Agile/Scrum methodologies, Product Management
- Technical documentation and automation
- Arduino-based embedded systems
